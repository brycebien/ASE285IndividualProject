# Requirements

As a user, I want to create accounts by inputting an email and a password. I expect the email and password to be stored in a database from a file using email:password format.

As a user, I want my password to be encrypted (hashed) to add security in case of a database breach.

As a user, I want to sign in using the email and password that I created earlier. I expect the program to tell me "true" if I input the correct username and password or "false" if I do not.
